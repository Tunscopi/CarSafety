# CarSafety
Hardware compatible (Arduino, Intel etc) code to detect alcohol level of driver and automatically inform remote locations. (Such as a police station)

Again, this is hardware dependent code:
You'd require a gas sensor (alcohol capable)
Motion sensor (Infrared/ultrasound could work although Infrared was used for this application)
Transmitter & receiver modules (ours was 433 Hz)
2 Microcontroller boards (An Arduino Uno and Nano were used)
LED's
